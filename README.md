A simple C++ & SDL program that draws a customizable Pusheen cat. Done as a project for university. Very unoptimized, but uses multithreading nonetheless!
Right now it has to be compiled with Visual Studio (preferably 2017). Hopefully this will change.

You can launch the built exe with a number (integer) as a parameter for the resolution of the cat, and two more for the window sizes. Once the program is running, you can navigate a menu in the console to change the appearance of the cat, using the WASD keys. After changing things, the cat has to be baked to reflect these changes, so don't forget to do that.

The program supports importing and exporting the cat settings so that you don't have to redo them every time.
